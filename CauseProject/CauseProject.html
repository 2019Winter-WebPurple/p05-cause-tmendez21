            <h2>A Sad Truth</h2> <!--the title of the next paragraph-->
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout history, certain dog breeds have earned bad and notorious reputations, some of the most popular being Pitbulls, Dobermans, and Saint Bernards. People have formed harmful stereotypes about these breeds. Pitbulls' reputation is due to unfit owners breeding them for dog fighting, which the dogs cannot control. Dobermans have earned their reputation because they were originally bred to be guard dogs, which they are good at. However, being loyal doesnot equivalate a dog to being dangerous. Dobermans can also seem intimidating to some people, which only adds to their stigma.</p> <!--a paragraph about the background of the topic-->
            
            <h2>Currently</h2> <!--the title of the next paragraph-->
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All over the world, select dog breeds are not allowed at certain locations, including parks, stores, or even neighborhoods. In fact, even <i>pet stores</i> may prohibit certain breeds from coming onto the property. For example, Petsmart, a very popular pet store, did not allow Blu, a nine-week-old Pitbull from participating in a puppy party. They stated that "bully breeds" were not allowed to participate in any off-leash activities. There are even specific states that have dog-related bans.</p> <!--a paragraph about how the topic is currently a problem-->

            <h2>How Can We Fix This?</h2> <!--the title of the next paragraph-->
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several ways in which people around the world can end these horrible dog stigmas. For example, simply educating themselves and those around them will make a huge difference. If only they knew the true personalities and temperaments of these so-called "harmful" dogs, then they would not be treated so harshly and unfairly. Another way that this siutuation can be fixed is adopting from shelters and adopting these breeds and giving them a safe place to call home. Finally, it is extremely important to be kind and respectful to these breeds, whether you see them at a park or walking down the street. Show them the same love and care that you would show your dog at home.</p> <!--a paragraph about how the topic can be solved-->
